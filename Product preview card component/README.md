## Questions
**What did I find difficult while building the project?**

I couldn't get rid of the small gap between the image and the bottom of the container. The problem was due to line height in the body.

**Which areas of my code I am unsure of?**

The way I implemented the image swap when switching to mobile devices. Not sure if this is the correct way to do it.

**Do I have any questions about best practices?**

implementation seems messy.
